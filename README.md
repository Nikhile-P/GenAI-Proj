Project Overview
This project is a practical implementation of a generative AI system designed for real-world text completion tasks. It leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library to serve a pre-trained GPT-2 model through a clean and responsive user interface built with Streamlit. The application demonstrates efficient model serving, interactive parameter tuning, and the ability to generate coherent, context-aware text sequences.

Core Functionalities
Dynamic Text Generation: Produces multiple, unique sentence completions from a user-provided prompt.

User-Controlled Parameters: Allows for real-time adjustment of key generation parameters, including maximum length and top-k sampling for creativity control.

Optimized Model Caching: Utilizes Streamlit's @st.cache_resource to load the model into memory once, ensuring minimal latency on subsequent prediction requests.

Modern UI/UX: A polished, two-column interface designed for intuitive interaction and clear presentation of results.

System Architecture & Tech Stack
The application is built on a stack designed for rapid development and deployment of machine learning applications:

Frontend: Streamlit is used for creating the interactive web interface.

Backend & Machine Learning:

Python serves as the backend language.

Hugging Face Transformers provides the core functionality for accessing and utilizing the pre-trained GPT-2 model.

PyTorch runs as the backend tensor library for the model.
